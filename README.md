# WEINBot
The Water-Efficient Industrial Navigating Robot (WEINBot) is a proof-of-concept automated industrial floor care vehicle that can effectively dislodge and collect solid grape waste from typical concrete winery flooring with minimal water use.
Successful collection of solid waste before manual hose-down greatly reduces the labor and water requirements during crush season, when typical cleanings are a tedious chore that can use hundreds of gallons of water.
While the device does not have the full array of sensors and software algorithms to robustly navigate the uncontrolled winery environment, basic control and sensor technologies are included so that limited demonstrations of those functionalities required for full autonomy may be accomplished.
In this way, our device will serve as a good foundation for potential further robotics research to develop the automation techniques required to navigate the bustling winery environment.
