## Obsolence of Python2
Due to time constraints, we write the WEINBot software in Python2 because this is what `Adafruit_BBIO` requires due to its dependency on `python-smbus` which is not yet available for Python3.
When this dependency is finally ported, porting the WEINBot software should be fairly trivial.
